## The Challenge

### Common IT Support Problems in Schools

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Teachers interrupt IT staff in corridors | Important details forgotten, no record |
| WhatsApp/phone requests | Scattered across devices, hard to track |
| No priority system | Urgent issues wait behind minor ones |
| No visibility | Principals don't know IT workload |
| Staff absence | Requests fall through the cracks |

### The Real Cost of Disorganized IT Support

- **Teacher time wasted**: Walking to IT office, waiting, explaining issues
- **Repeated requests**: Same issue reported multiple times
- **No accountability**: "I already told you about this last week"
- **Missed deadlines**: Critical equipment failures during exams

---

## The Solution

### What We Built

A conversational chatbot that lives inside **Google Chat**—the same platform your school already uses for communication.

### How It Works (The Simple Version)

```
Teacher has problem → Messages the bot → Bot creates ticket
                                              ↓
                                     Staff gets notified
                                              ↓
                                     Issue gets resolved
                                              ↓
                                   Teacher gets confirmation
```
